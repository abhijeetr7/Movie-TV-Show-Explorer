üöÄ Setup and Installation
To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository (or copy the code):
If this were a repository, you would clone it. For this single HTML file, simply copy the entire code provided into a new file named index.html (or any .html extension).

Obtain a TMDB API Key:

Sign up for a free account.

Once logged in, navigate to your profile settings.

Find the "API" section and request a new API Key (choose the "Developer" type).

Copy your API Key (v3 auth).

Insert Your API Key into the Code:

Open your index.html file in a text editor.

Locate the JavaScript section (within the <script> tags, usually near the end of the <body>).

Find the line:

const API_KEY = 'YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY';

Replace 'YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY' with the actual API key you obtained from TMDB. Make sure to keep the single quotes around your key.

// Example (replace with your actual key):
const API_KEY = 'your_actual_tmdb_api_key_here';
